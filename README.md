# data-analysis
Company name: Lariat (rent a car company) the goal: maximize the profit, minimize the costs. 
I collected the data, sorted and analyzed it by using advanced Microsoft Excel formulas.Used bar charts.
Suggested to owners to close the branches with no/minimum profit and open 10 new branches in locations with more profit. Figured what car make is doing more profit and told to buy 1000 more cars, to get rid of the cars which are doing less profit. Increase the price for 30% and include cross selling.
